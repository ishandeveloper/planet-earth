## Building Immersive Experiences on the Web
This repository contains the code for the project that I will be building on stage at JSConf. It is a vanilla JavaScript project created using Vite. To get started, simply run `yarn dev`


#### Branches
The repository has two important branches:

**main**: This branch contains the final version of the project.

**starter**: This branch contains a starter project that you can use to get started with your own immersive experiences.


### Getting Started
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

    ```
    git clone git@github.com:ishandeveloper/planet-earth.git
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:
    ```
    yarn install
    ```
3. Start the dev server
    ```
    yarn dev
    ```
    
The development server will open a browser window at http://localhost:5173. You can make changes to the code and the changes will be reflected in the browser window in real time.
